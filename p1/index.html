	<h2>Biographical Note:</h2>
	<p>Born in Burbank, California, I have lived in the greater Boston area ever since my undergraduate days at M.I.T. 
	In 1976, I joined Wally Gilbert's lab in the Biological Labs on Divinity Ave (entrance flanked by two bronze rhinos), where I was an early  
	user of the method for which he won a Nobel Prize ("Maxam-Gilbert" DNA sequencing). I joined the Cambridge-based biotechnology company Biogen in 1983, and for nearly thirty years oversaw a core facility 
	that sequenced virtually every plasmid construct assembled there, reporting, curating, and storing the results in searchable form.</p>
	<p>Since sequence data is represented as unwieldy strings of G, A, T, and C characters, essentially nothing can be readily inferred from it 
	without the aid of computers. Fortunately, as sequencing technologies evolved, so did affordable computing. In the Biolabs, we started with a machine 
	running on an 8 bit Intel 8080 chip with dual 8" floppy drives running code written in BASIC. At Biogen, I developed a client-server application written in <a href="http://www.4d.com">4D</a> to 
	interact with my clients, to drive laboratory automation, and to procure and analyze data. In 2001 I added a read-only web site using 
	semi-dynamic pages for data delivery hosted by the 4D server. Later we built a  web services portal (using SOAP) to access analytical capability on a remote unix box from the local 4D GUI. 
	I have been intrigued by the wide use of PHP and MySql and intend to replace the client-facing functionality formerly provided by the 
	4D app with solutions based on these or similar industry-standard technologies.</p>
	<p>I currently live in a rural corner of Framingham with my wife (Donna, a veterinarian), two kids (Emily, 18, and Henry, 16), and two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragdoll">ragdoll cats</a>.</p>
